MealManager
====

A web app that allows the management of recipes with the goal of aggregating required ingredients into a shopping list. 


The planned set of functionality is:
* Ability to maintain a centralized list of Ingredients
* Per-user lists of recipes, meal plans and "preferred sources" of ingredients
* Integration with Google Accounts for login
* Management of multiple Meal Plans (lists of recipes) 
* Shopping view by meal plan (or by Source)
* Attaching "Quantity On Hand" to meal plans to generate list of things that need to be purchased vs things already on-hand


Longer term complementary projects may include
* Chrome extension to harvest ingredients from recipes on the web
* Mobile App
